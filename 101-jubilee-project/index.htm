                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I've made my home base in the White Mountains of Arizona, with my family. My interest into tech began as I took my three youngest children to a coding class and was asked to stay as a parent volunteer. During the same time period, my older two boys' junior high and high school robotics teams competed at the World level. As I attended their competitions and classes, I decided I wanted to learn to code and began taking classes.</p>

                        <p>After my first class, I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build and create designs that would fill specific needs. I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch into front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
